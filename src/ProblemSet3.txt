4.
    a. The memory value of i is 5. The memory value of j is 8. i's value is changed
       to 2 + 5 * 8 (42). The final value of i is 42. The final value of j is 8.

    b. The memory value of i is 3. The memory value of j is 8. If the value of
       i times 3 is greater than the value j, then i is changed to 3 times j, otherwise
       j is set to the value of 3 times i. The final memory value of i is 24 ( 3 times 8).
       The final value of j is 8.

    c. The memory value of i is 1. The memory value of j is 10. While the value
       of 3 times the value of i is less than or equal to the value of j, set the
       value of i to 3 times the current value of i. The final memory value of
       i is 9. The final memory value of j is 10.       

14. Using the example code provided in 'problem_14.c', the type derivation is
    as follows:
        int *x is a pointer to an address space that is the size of an int.
        int a[15] is a sized array of 15 integers.

        *x = 7 sets the value of what x points to (an integer) to 7.
        a[*x] = *x + 4 sets the value of array a at index 7 to 7 plus 4 (11).

    Using my example code, the assignments are confirmed to work correctly.
